Note that in other cases the number of results will be more managable, so do not worry about trying to search for specific exploits with other services.</p>\n<p>Using <code>search php_cgi</code> will give us one result. We can now use the <code>use</code> command followed by the exploit name to tell Metasploit that we want to use this exploit.</p>\n<p>Once we are using the exploit we can now make sure that all of the exploits options are properly set. To do so, we will use the <code>options</code> command.</p>\n<p>The options command shows us that there are four required options, and that three of them are already set. We can use the <code>set</code> command to set the <code>RHOSTS</code> option. The <code>RHOSTS</code> option specifies the target address. <code>set RHOSTS target</code></p>\n<p>Once all the required options are set, we can use the <code>exploit</code> command to run the exploit.</p>\n<p>Some exploits will result in a meterpreter shell, we can get to a normal shell by entering the command <code>shell</code>.</p>",
