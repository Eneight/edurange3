About</h2>\n<p>Total Recon is a story-based game designed to teach how network\nprotocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP can be used to reveal information about\na network. Total Recon focuses on reconnaissance to determine hosts in an\nunknown network. You will explore tradeoffs between speed and stealth when\nusing tools such as nmap.</p>\n<hr />",

Background</h2>\n<p>Whether you're doing a large-scale security audit, inventorying a network, or\nanalyzing network response times, nmap is a powerful tool to help you complete\nyour task. In order to understand this exercise, you should be familiar with the\n3-way handshake for TCP. A basic understanding of ICMP and UDP will also\nbe helpful. This exercise is not designed to teach you all of the details of those\nprotocols, but rather to show you how they can be used for network exploring.\nYou will learn how to discover hosts on a network, determine which ports on\nthose hosts are open, and what applications are running on them.\nIn practice, each message that is sent over the Internet uses multiple protocols,\nwhich are divided into five layers: physical layer, link layer, network layer,\ntransport layer and application layer. For example, the physical layer handles\nwhat is encoded as a 0 or 1. The link layer handles communication on local area\nnetworks (LANs). The network layer handles routing on wide area networks\n(WANs), e.g. IP. The transport layer handles ports and processes, e.g. TCP,\nUDP, ICMP. The application layer handles applications communicating with\neach other, e.g. http, ftp, by nesting packets inside of packets. In general, these\npackets correspond to layers of functionality: TCP is connection-oriented and is\nresponsible for a number of things including reliably conveying messages between\nthe application layers on two hosts. The three-way handshake establishes this\npairing with the following sequence: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK You can get a\nsummary of the important protocols and their layers in: Chapter 4 of Hacking:\nThe Art of Exploitation (Erickson)[1] or Chapter 2 of Counter Hack Reloaded\n[2].
