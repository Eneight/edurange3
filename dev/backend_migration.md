# ---notes---
This document is to help track the progress of the migration from 
the legacy flask/jinja system to the new flask / react system 
using AJAX requests and responses.

Many of the functions will no longer need to be used, or will be 
done using other strategies.  The notes are in a free-form state 
at the moment, so plz bear with me. - Jonah (exoriparian)

# forms will entirely be discontinued, and in some cases, replaced by schemas.  
# However, in many cases, these forms are only validating 1-2 items,
# meaning the requests can be validated within the routes themselves,
# and no schema (or form) will be necessary.
