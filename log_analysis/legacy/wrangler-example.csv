CMBEGIN	File_Wrangler	1600806393	/home/RedOne	cat instructions.txt 	%Description#%#File Wrangler teaches the basics of files and directories in the Linux command line. You will use basic navigation commands to view files and directories and to move around between directories. You will also use commands to create new files and directories and commands for renaming copying moving and deleting them. Finally you will use commands to view and change file permissions.#%##%#Background#%#Moving between directories and manipulating files and directories are essential foundations for intermediate and advanced security exercises. This exercise will also introduce you to key commands for managing file and directory-level access control in Linux. The man pages for given commands can help when you are unsure of how to solve a challenge.#%##%#Learning Objectives#%#By the end of this exercise you will be able to:#%#* print the current working directory#%#* list the contents of a directory#%#* view the contents of a file#%#* move to another directory#%#* obtain information about directory and file type#%#* list the contents of a directory with and without hidden files#%#* look up the manual page for a command#%#* manipulate files (create move and copy)#%#* view permissions for a file or directory#%#* change permissions for a file or directory#%##%#Instructions#%#Work on each task and answer the EDURange question as directed in the task instructions.#%##%#Start on the first task by typing the following into the terminal:#%##%#cat task1#%#==========================================================================#%#%	RedOne@File_Wrangler
