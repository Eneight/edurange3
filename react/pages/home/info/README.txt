This is a whole secondary route just for LOGGED OUT info  (it can be accessed from logged in as well obviously)

for example, the URL would look like 

edurange.org:5000/info
edurange.org:5000/info/docs
edurange.org:5000/info/contact 
edurange.org:5000/info/help 

etc...

probably the help and contact pages would have different options based on being logged in but that can be handled 
in the components themselves.
