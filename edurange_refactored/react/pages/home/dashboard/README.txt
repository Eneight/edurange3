newDash (routed through DashRouter.js) is what will eventually replace 'edurange_refactored/templates/dashboard', but both should be kept for now 

all of the subdirectories that branch from here are 'pages' that branch from the actual dashboard in the new UI
with the exception of /main and /cards,

/main is where the content for 'edurange.org:5000/dashboard' are
/cards is just some helper classes & components, etc

apart from that it's 

edurange.org:5000/dashboard/account
edurange.org:5000/dashboard/scenarios
edurange.org:5000/dashboard/notifications
edurange.org:5000/dashboard/instructor
edurange.org:5000/dashboard/admin

etc...
