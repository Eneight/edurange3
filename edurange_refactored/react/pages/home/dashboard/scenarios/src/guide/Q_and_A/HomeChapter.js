        To play a scenario, connect with SSH!  SSH connection information and connection buttons are on the bottom of this guide viewport.

        Each challenge in the SSH game is paired with a question in this window, so when you find a secret answer or flag,
        come back to this window, and enter your answer into the provided field.  If you got the right answer, you will be awarded points!
