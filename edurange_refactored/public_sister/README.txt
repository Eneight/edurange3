This is a supplemental folder to the 'public' folder that was made to ease the migration and (try to) avoid breaking anything in the process.

it is not redundant.

neither this folder nor the 'public' folder or any of their contents should be replaced at this time.

ultimately, this 'should' be in /edurange_refactored/api/routing or something along those lines.  that should be the new 'frontend->backend'
script directory rather than 'public', for clarity

but this '_sister' system works well and is less confusing for now...
