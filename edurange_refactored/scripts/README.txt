this new 'edurange_refactored/scripts' directory is for FRONT-END-ONLY related higher order scripts, 
such as react-routing and other universal (front-end-restricted) things of that nature. 
they should be further categorized into child directories.

all higher order things in any way backend related, including backend routes and auth schemas, 
which are used by the front-end, should be in '/edurange_refactored/api/example', not here.

note: at this time, the exact structure of this directory is still a WIP
