This document will list the locations for important files, directories, 
functions, etc for the exo_prestage branch

Important note:  this is only for the new directories and files.  
                 for legacy directory and file locations, see wiki.

Flask:

edurange_refactored/

    /flask                                  Main (new) flask dir.
        
        /config                             Important configuration files can go here, currently unused.

        /modules                            The majority of my updates are here.  includes db tools, 
                                            flask backend routes, authorisation utility and config files, etc
            
            /db                             Modules that are related specifically to SQLAlchemy 

                /schemas                    Database request schemata (marshmallow library currently)
            
            /routes                         This is where route files go.  there are some already here, which you
                                            can add to, or you can create your own and initialize them with flask 
            
            /utils                          A more general directory for 'utility' modules that don't fit 
                                            in any of the other module directories.  
            

    react 

        /api 

            /config                         Important configuration files relating specifically to API calls to 
                                            flask go here.
                AxiosConfig.js              Very important your IP is correct here!
            
            /common                         probably going to be removed.

            /test                           general API testing related files.  these files are meant to be general purpose API
                                            testers OR specific usecase testers that don't fit better elsewhere. 

        /assets                             .svgs, images, css, etc.  

        /config                             high level react config files, currently unused.

        /entry                              just holds the single EduRangeEntry.js file that creates the context and 
                                            serves as the 'gateway' to the rest of the app.

            EduRangeEntry.js                The entry component.  Provides intial render into .html, and is primary context provider.
                                            Renders <Home_router.js /> but that's all.

        /modules                            similar to the flask version, but for frontend business logic scripts.  this includes 
                                            'context, nav, scenarios, shells, ui'. 
        
        /pages                              The main react UI, where all the Component.js files go other than entry. 
                                    
            /home                           Top level 

                Home_router.js              'Context provider' for the logged out 'menu', and the 'root' of the website at / (or in dev, /edurange3/)
                                            defines routes that extend from /edurange3/ (including /login and /dashboard)
                                            This is the only file that is 'served' by EduRangeEntry.js, the gateway react script.
                
                /info                       all the docs, abouts, info, links, etc etc
                    /about 
                    /contact 
                    /docs 
                    /help 
                
                /options                    general user options
                    /accessibility          accessibility options
                    /themes                 new color themes for the future
                                            note: we might not need separate directories but they're here if we want them

                /dashboard                  logged in / protected 

                    Dashboard_router.js     'Context provider' for the logged in dashboard 'menu', defines routes that extend from /edurange3/dashboard

                    /scenarios              home is list view, individual scenario is full view (lots of this is under HEAVY construction.
                                            If you make any updates here, especially to the full view or the helper scripts, 
                                            please put it in a different directory or use distinct new filenames so there's no confusion)

                        Scenarios_router.js Just like the other routers, this is the main 'Context provider' for the scenarios area, at least in terms
                                            of routing and higher level pieces of state. 

                            /src/guide      Full view and 'brain' of the normal scenario view.  HEAVY CONSTRUCTION 

                            /chat           Chat.  Placeholder. 

                            

                    /admin                  admin panel within dashboard (placeholder, needs update)
                    /account                user account controls (pw reset, email change, etc) (placeholder, needs update)
                    /instructor             instructor stuff (placeholder)
                    /testing                idk (unused) 
                    /users                  older scripts relating to 'user groups', but may be removed
