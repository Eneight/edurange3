There are 3 tokens that are used with the edurange3 app.
In addition, SSL certificates are (generally speaking)
required to use and develop the app.

TOKENS:
    + JWT:  JavaScript Web Token:  An elegant method for authenticating.
            
            When JWTs are created, the creator includes a 'payload', 
            which generally takes the form of a simple JSON style object.

            The secret key is then used in combination w/ the payload to
            generate the token signature, which prevents tampering.
            
            This means that any app can verify the authenticity of JWTs
            if they have the secret key value, but the payload can't be altered
            without a value mismatch between expected signature and actual.

            IMPORTANT:  Because JWTs contain all the system requires to
            authenticate your requests, protect JWTs the same way you
            would a password.  This is also why SSL certs are important.

            Another note:  The previous point is also why the JWT is
            held in the user's browser as HTTP-only.  This means that
            the DOM (and JS) does not have access to the value.  This
            setup means that a XSS attack can't make you submit your JWT
            with the use of JavaScript injection.

    + CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery tokens

            CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):

            CSRF attacks are where a malicious website causes a user's 
            browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site 
            where the user is already authenticated.

            JWT and CSRF: When using JWTs for authentication, CSRF attacks 
            can still be a concern. Even though JWTs are typically stored in 
            HTTP-only cookies to prevent access by JavaScript (mitigating XSS 
            attacks), they do not inherently protect against CSRF. This is because 
            the browser automatically sends cookies with requests to the domain 
            they belong to, regardless of whether the request originated from a 
            malicious site.

            CSRF Tokens: To mitigate CSRF attacks, sites often use CSRF tokens. 
            These are unique, random values generated by the server and sent to 
            the client. The client must include this token in subsequent requests 
            (usually in headers or request bodies), and the server verifies its 
            presence and correctness before executing the request.

            Why Not HTTP-Only for CSRF Tokens: CSRF tokens are not typically 
            stored in HTTP-only cookies because they need to be accessible by 
            JavaScript on the client-side. The client's JavaScript code must be 
            able to read the token and include it in requests (e.g., in AJAX 
            requests or form submissions). If the token were in an HTTP-only 
            cookie, JavaScript wouldn't be able to access it, making it 
            impossible to include the token in requests as required for 
            CSRF protection.

            Working Together: In a secure setup, JWTs are stored in HTTP-only 
            cookies to prevent XSS attacks, while CSRF tokens are stored in 
            a way that allows JavaScript access (e.g., in a regular cookie 
            or in the HTML body) and included in requests to protect against 
            CSRF attacks. The server validates both the JWT (for authentication) 
            and the CSRF token (for request legitimacy) to ensure security.

            By using both JWTs and CSRF tokens in this manner, web applications 
            can achieve a robust defense against both XSS and CSRF attacks.
